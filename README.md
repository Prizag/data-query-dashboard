# Data Query Dashboard Prototype

## Introduction
Welcome to the Data Query Dashboard Prototype! This project is a strategic marketing approach for a groundbreaking Gen AI Analytics tool that democratizes data insights across business units. The dashboard prototype demonstrates query interaction and result visualization, allowing non-technical teams to make data-driven decisions efficiently.

## Features
- **Natural Language Query Input**: Allows users to enter complex business queries in plain English.
- **AI-powered Suggestions**: Provides intelligent query suggestions to assist users.
- **Query Processing Simulation**: Simulates AI-based query processing.
- **Query History Section**: Displays previously submitted queries.
- **Result Visualization**: Showcases mock data insights using charts.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux for efficient global state handling.
- **Loading & Error Handling**: Ensures a smooth user experience with appropriate feedback.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts or Chart.js (Optional)
